        <h3>The Merchant of Venice</h3>
        <h4>SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</h4>
        <h5>
            <p class="stage-direction">Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants</p>
            <h6 class="name">PORTIA</h6>
            <p class="speech PORTIA">I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
            Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
            I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
            There's something tells me, but it is not love,
            I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
            Hate counsels not in such a quality.
            But lest you should not understand me well,--
            And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
            I would detain you here some month or two
            Before you venture for me. I could teach you
            How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
            So will I never be: so may you miss me;
            But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
            That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
            They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
            One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
            Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
            And so all yours. O, these naughty times
            Put bars between the owners and their rights!
            And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
            Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
            I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
            To eke it and to draw it out in length,
            To stay you from election.</p>

            <h6 class="name">BASSANIO</h6>

            <p class="speech BASSANIO">Let me choose
            For as I am, I live upon the rack.
            PORTIA
            Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
            What treason there is mingled with your love.
            BASSANIO
            None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
            Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
            There may as well be amity and life
            'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.</p>

            <h6 class="name">PORTIA</h6>

            <p class="speech PORTIA">Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
            Where men enforced do speak anything.</p>

            <h6 class="name">BASSANIO</h6>

            <p class="speech BASSANIO">Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.</p>

            <h6 class="name">PORTIA</h6>

            <p class="speech PORTIA">Well then, confess and live.</p>

            <h6 class="name">BASSANIO</h6>

            <p class="speech BASSANIO">'Confess' and 'love'
            Had been the very sum of my confession:
            O happy torment, when my torturer
            Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
            But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</p>

            <h6 class="name">PORTIA</h6>

            <p class="speech PORTIA">Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
            If you do love me, you will find me out.
            Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
            Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
            Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
            Fading in music: that the comparison
            May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
            And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
            And what is music then? Then music is
            Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
            To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
            As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
            That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
            And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
            With no less presence, but with much more love,
            Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
            The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
            To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
            The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
            With bleared visages, come forth to view
            The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
            Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
            I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself</p>

            <p class="speech PORTIA">SONG.
            Tell me where is fancy bred,
            Or in the heart, or in the head?
            How begot, how nourished?
            Reply, reply.
            It is engender'd in the eyes,
            With gazing fed; and fancy dies
            In the cradle where it lies.
            Let us all ring fancy's knell
            I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.</p>
